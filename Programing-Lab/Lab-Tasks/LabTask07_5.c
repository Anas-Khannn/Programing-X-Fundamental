/*








In this program, an array of type double is declared with 5 elements. Each element in a double
 array typically occupies 8 bytes in memory (since a double has a size of 8 bytes).

When we print data or &data[0], both represent the base address of the array —
 the memory location where the first element is stored.

The addresses of the subsequent elements (&data[1], &data[2], etc.) increase by 8 bytes each,
 because each double element takes up 8 bytes of memory.
