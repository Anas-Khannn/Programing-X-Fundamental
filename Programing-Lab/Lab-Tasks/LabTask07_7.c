/*
In this program, we learned how to use functions to make our code modular and how to pass arrays as arguments to functions in C.

The program is divided into two main functions apart from main():

inputData() – This function takes input from the user and stores it in the array.

Display_data() – This function displays all the elements of the array.

By defining separate functions for each task, we make the code easier to read, understand, and maintain. 
This approach is called modular programming, where the program is divided into smaller, manageable parts (modules).

When we pass the array to these functions, we actually pass the address (reference) of the first element of the array.
This means the function can directly modify or access the array elements defined in the main function — no need to return the array.
